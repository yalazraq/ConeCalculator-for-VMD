# ConeCalculator-for-VMD

The program calculates cone angles for star shaped morphologies in charged molecule systems.

Process:
1. Run the app
2. app will ask you to choose files to load, a topology file and a dcd file
3. pick the frame number you are trying to use
4. enter as many residue IDs along the edge of the base of the cone as you see fit (minimum 3 or results wont be accurate)
5. choose the Residue ID of the tip of the cone CORRECTLY (BE SURE TO PICK RIGHT ONE OR PROGRAM MIGHT CRASH)
6. READ STEP 5, VERY IMPORTANT
7. program repeats to step 3 until you are satisfied with the number of cones you need in your program

Done.


program can be ran on command line, but I prefer you run in either spyder or vscode
